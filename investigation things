find `pwd` -type f -iname '*.php' -exec echo {} \; -exec head -1 {} \; |grep -B1 'GLOBALS\|preg_replace\|array_diff_ukey\|gzuncompress\|gzinflate\|post_var'

With that command you would go into the infected cpanel accounts public_html and it will list all the files that contain more than likely malicious code on the first line. 

The most common files you will find, for me anyways, are found using this:

for i in USER; do find /home/$i/public_html/ -type f -iname '*.php' | xargs grep -l 'sF=\|qV=' >> infected ; done
